# History of SHSO Remakes
## Ultimate Squad (Closed down)
Earliest iteration, aimed to remake the game from scratch in Unity.
## Retro Squad (Closed down)
An offshoot from Ultimate Squad under the lead of an undisclosed contributor, basically the same direction which is to remake the game in Unity from scratch using extracted assets from the game's cache.
## Legacy Squad (Closed down)
A parallel project that aimed to tweak the game and make it in Unreal Engine, but wasn't faithful to the original and wanted to do things their own way. Closed down after a lot of drama.
## SHSU (Super Hero Squad Underground, formerly Viking Squad)
Viking Squad is an offshoot from Retro Squad under the lead of CrabFu, led the current direction of purely reverse-engineering the old game files with the help of the asset contributors and putting them in a usable Unity Project then trying to fix and improve features. Later renamed to SHSU.
